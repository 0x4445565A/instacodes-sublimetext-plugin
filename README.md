instacodes-sublimetext-plugin
=============================

A simple plugin that allows you to use the instacod.es upload feature via sublime's right click and file menu.

Features
=============================

User can highlight text and with a right click they can select "Post To InstaCod.es",
which automatically grabs code selection and code syntax and posts it to InstaCod.es
using your default browser.

User can open a file and navigate to File->Post To Instacod.es which will result in
their whole file being used as the source code instead of just a snippet.
This, of course, also autoselects your syntax (based on what sublime says) and uses
your default browser to submit your code.

Install Instrutions

```sh
$ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages
